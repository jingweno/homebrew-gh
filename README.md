How do I install gh?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap jingweno/gh` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you
can `brew install jingweno/gh/gh`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/jingweno/homebrew-gh/master/gh.rb
```

Docs
----
`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew).
